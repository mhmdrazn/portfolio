        Memory is one of the important elements in a computer that has a central role in processing data and programs. We can liken this memory to computer memory. Its function is to store data that will be used by the computer when operating. <br/> <br/> There are two main actions related to memory: writing and reading. When we write to memory, we store data....</p>

        Like the heart of a computer, the CPU or central processing unit is the unit that is responsible for executing the various programs that we run. Various programs such as Microsoft Office, Safari, or Opera, consist of a series of individual operations called instructions, because these instructions "instruct" the computer what to do.

        If we develop a small program for our CPU that allows division of two numbers by performing repeated subtraction operations. For example, to divide 16 by 4, we perform repeated subtraction such as 16 minus 4, 4, 4, until we reach zero or a negative number as a marker for completion. <br/> <br/> However, this approach is very inefficient...
